# groupof6shuffle
I utilized this code to generate random groups of six for our BSAAC activities.

Given a csv file with the first column consisting of names and the second columns consisting of categories like what committee a BSAAC(Bowdoin Student Athlete Advisory Committee) member is in, this code will randomly create groups of 6 where every group member is from a different committee. 

When running the code in the terminal, type the name of the file including its path name, add a space, and then the name (including the path) of the csv file. To find the path name, you can typically right click the file in the explorer sidebar in Visual Studio Code. You can the select 'copy path' and you'll be able to just paste that in. 

Format: [path of file to run] [path of csv file]
